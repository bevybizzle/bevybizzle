**Hello!** welcome to my GitHub page! 

My name is Ryan Bevin. I'm an Embedded Software Engineer from Northern Ireland.

**What do I know?** I only know one thing for sure... and that is that I know nothing!

**How did I get into programming/coding?** Arduino! Actually I was studying and learning ladder logic for PLCs and I enjoyed that so my lecturer suggested getting an Arduino Uno, then bada *bing* bada **boom!**

**What language do I use daily?** I use C for embedded systems. Writing device drivers and library code for embedded C libraries. I also use Python as and when required.

**Preferred editor:** VS Code is the main editor right now. I'd be keen to try Neovim or Emacs but haven't made the jump yet. 

What else... I can't think of anything! If you want to know anymore **just ask!**

**Thanks for Reading!**
