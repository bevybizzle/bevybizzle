**Hello!** welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Ryan Bevin. I'm an Embedded Software Engineer from Northern Ireland.

What do I know:
- I only know one thing for sure... and that is that I know nothing!

Favourite operating system:
- For gaming? Windows
- For programming? Linux (PopOS at the time of writing)/ Sometimes MacOS
- For thinking differently? MacOS

How did I get into programming/coding?
- Arduino! Actually I was studying and learning ladder logic for PLCs and I enjoyed that so my lecturer suggested getting an Arduino Uno, then bada *bing* bada **boom!**

What language do I use daily?
- I use C for embedded systems. Writing device drivers and library code for embedded C libraries.
- I also use Python as and when required.

Preferred editor:
- VS Code is the main editor right now. I'd be keen to try Neovim or Emacs but haven't made the jump yet. 

What else... I can't think of anything! If you want to know anymore **just ask!**

**Thanks for Reading!**
