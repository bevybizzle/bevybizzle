**Hello!** welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Ryan Bevin. I'm an Embedded Software Engineer from Northern Ireland.

What do I know:
- I only know one thing for sure... and that is that I know nothing!

Favourite operating system:
- For gaming? Windows ![Windows](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-0078D6?style=for-the-badge&logo=windows&logoColor=white)
- For programming? Linux (PopOS at the time of writing)/ Sometimes MacOS ![Pop!\_OS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pop!_OS-48B9C7?style=for-the-badge&logo=Pop!_OS&logoColor=white)
- For thinking differently? MacOS ![macOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/mac%20os-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=macos&logoColor=F0F0F0)

How did I get into programming/coding?
- Arduino! ![Arduino](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Arduino-00979D?style=for-the-badge&logo=Arduino&logoColor=white) Actually I was studying and learning ladder logic for PLCs and I enjoyed that so my lecturer suggested getting an Arduino Uno, then bada *bing* bada **boom!**

What language do I use daily?
- I use C for embedded systems. ![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/c-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white) Writing device drivers and library code for embedded C libraries.
- I also use Python as and when required. ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

Preferred editor:
- VS Code is the main editor right now. ![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio%20Code-0078d7.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white) I'd be keen to try Neovim or Emacs but haven't made the jump yet. 

What else... I can't think of anything! If you want to know anymore **just ask!**

**Thanks for Reading!**
